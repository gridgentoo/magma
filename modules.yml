# This is the default module configuration for an LTE magma deployment.
# You can specify your own module file using the environment variable
# MAGMA_MODULES_FILE

# These are modules included in the magma repo which you want to include
native_modules:
  - orc8r
  - lte

# These are modules with code that lives outside the magma repo
# Each entry under external_modules should specify a host_path key which points
# to the location of the module directory on your host machine.
# If the host_path key is relative, it will be resolved relative to the root
# of the magma repository.
# If the host_path key is absolute, it will remain unchanged.
# Environment variables will be expanded in the final path.
external_modules: []
#  - host_path: $MY_PATH/my_module
#  - host_path: ../../my_module
