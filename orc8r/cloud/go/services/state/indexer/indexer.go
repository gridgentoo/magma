// Indexer creates a set of secondary indices for consumption by a service.
// Each Indexer should
// 	- be owned by a single service
//	- store per-version data in a properly isolated manner,
// 	  e.g. different SQL tables for different indexer versions
//	- have its generated data exposed by the owning service,
//	  i.e. only one other service should access the generated data directly via the storage interface.
