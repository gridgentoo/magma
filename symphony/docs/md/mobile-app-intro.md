> Manage and track your equipment and deployments using a mobile app

The Mobile App is an extension of the Inventory system and it can be used to manage equipment, view locations, perform site surveys, and create connectivity coverage maps.

## Getting the App

The latest version of the Mobile App is available in the Google Play Store to white-listed accounts:
[https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cloud.thesymphony](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cloud.thesymphony)

If that link is unavailable to your Google Play Store account, please notify your contact at Facebook to ensure all software usage agreements are in place and then you can be added to the white-list.

## Login
Login to the app using the same username/password that are used for the web UI.  Use the subdomain of this site for the `Company` field.  For example, if this page is at https://testing.thesymphony.cloud use `testing` for the Company name.
