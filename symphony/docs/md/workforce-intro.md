Manage and track your projects and work orders.

### [Configure](/workorders/configure)
Workforce management works with templates.
Creating a Project or Work Order starts with selecting a template.
This template will include the required structure for the newly created Project \ Work Order.
Pretty similar to Inventory.
> Yet, there is an important difference: Once a Project \ Work Order is created, it is no longer dependent on the template it was created from. Its structure will be the same as was the template at time of creation. It is not possible to add new properties to this existing Work Order, only editing existing ones.

- Add or edit work order templates.
- Add or edit project templates. Project templates allow you to quickly create similar projects containing the same work order types.


### [Projects View](/workorders/projects)
- See all projects in either list or map view.
- Add or edit project instances.

### [Work Orders Search](/workorders/search)
- Filter work orders by type/location/name etc. View them in either list or map view.
- Add or edit work order instances.
