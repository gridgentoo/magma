"""Pyinventory is a python package that allows for querying and modifying the
FBC platform inventory using graphql.

This module contains the client that allows to connect to inventory. The client
allows different kind of operations: querying and creating of locations, equipments,
positions and links.

Example of how to connect:
```
from pyinventory import InventoryClient
# since inventory is multi tenant system you will need to insert which
# partner you connect as
client = InventoryClient(email, password, "tenant_name")
location = client.addLocation(-1.22,2.66, ('City', 'Brooklyn'))
client.addEquipment('HW1569', 'Antenna HW', location, {'altitude': 53.5})
